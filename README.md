# Prostate-Cancer Prediction
This repository contains implementations of various deep learning models trained on the Prostate cANcer graDe Assessment (PANDA) Challenge from Kaggle for predicting prostate cancer. We partnered up to explore different architectures and assess their effectiveness in this critical medical task.

We, Rohit Thakkar and Darshil Shukla, have collaborated to explore various deep learning architectures and analyze their performance for prostate cancer prediction. Our joint effort reflects a commitment to advancing medical image analysis through machine learning techniques.

Feel free to explore the models implemented in this repository and provide feedback or contributions to further enhance our research efforts.

Implemented Models

Description: The VAN (Variable-Architecture Network) model is a custom deep learning architecture designed specifically for prostate cancer prediction. This model incorporates adaptive features and flexible architecture to effectively handle the complexities of the dataset.
2. VGG Model
Results: View VGG Model Results
Description: The VGG (Visual Geometry Group) model is a classic convolutional neural network architecture known for its simplicity and effectiveness. We explore its performance on the prostate cancer dataset to evaluate its suitability for medical image classification tasks.
3. Xception Model
Results: View Xception Model Results
Description: The Xception model is an advanced convolutional neural network architecture known for its depthwise separable convolutions. We investigate its performance on prostate cancer prediction to leverage its potential for feature extraction and representation.
4. Inception V3 Model
Results: View Inception V3 Model Results and Additional Results
Description: The Inception V3 model is another popular deep learning architecture designed for image classification tasks. We analyze its performance on the prostate cancer dataset and provide additional insights from different experiments.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the PANDA Resized Train Dataset (512x512) from Kaggle. Due to its large size and privacy concerns, the dataset is not included in this repository. You can access the dataset from the Kaggle link provided above.
